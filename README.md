This is a simple Java program that demonstrates file handling operations such as writing to a file, reading from a file, searching for a name in a file, editing a name in a file, and deleting a name from a file.

## Features

- **Write name in file**: Allows the user to enter a name and writes it to a file.

1. **Compile**: Compile the program using `javac FileHandling.java`.
2. **Run**: Run the program using `java FileHandling`.
3. **Menu**: Choose an option from the menu to perform the desired operation.

## Example

```
